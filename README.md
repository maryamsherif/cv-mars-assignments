# Computer Vision Course - Assignment 1
## Team : Mars ðŸŒ 
### Project description:
The main aim of this assignment is to experiment with histogram modification approaches, alongside seeing their effects on images. In more details, given an input image, as a first step, the contrast of such an image is to be evaluated. Second, the three approaches (contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and gray-scale transformation) are to be performed in the input image (producing three outputs). Finally, for each of the three outputs, the contrast is re-evaluated.
