# Computer Vision Course - Assignment 2
## Team : Mars ðŸŒ 
### Project description:
The main aim of this assignment is to analyze the interaction between
various scoring functions and automatic threshold detection. In more
specific terms, scoring functions (corner detections) are to be applied
to the image, then the resulting gradient magnitudes are to be
subjected to automatic threshold detection. As per that, the following
components are to be implemented:
1. Corner detection:
    a. Harris.
    b. SUSAN.
2. Automatic threshold detection:
    a. Calculate convex hull.
